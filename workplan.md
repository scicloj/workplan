# Scicloj Workplan

Dreams and aspirations is where our future begins. We _must_ dream, otherwise we cannot change. It is through dream that we see and explore what lies ahead.

Planning is the act of bringing our dream of the future into the present. It is a tool for ensuring that our dreams will come true.

Community building is about people. Without people, there is no community. A community needs to be a good place to stay.

The planning systems we create need to live in tandem with people. We do not seek alienation but warmth and inclusivity.

## What is the workplan?

The SciCloj community has grown organically out of an association of people  interested in making doing data science in Clojure fun an easy.

At this moment, however, we need to experiment a lot to determine what it means to do data science in Clojure? What does a dataset in Clojure look like?

We would like to develop a process where we make this experimentation fun, accessible, simple and efficient.

To that end, this workplan describes key goals and projects that we currently believe are essential to this process.

## A Living Document

This workplan is a living document. The point is not to dictate what people do, but track and perhaps help bring focus and coherence to work that people are already doing. So we'll need to update it regularly. Therefore, one of the projects this documents decribes is itself: [Workplan Coordination](https://hackmd.io/jJPlzA2eSPWOGH2eOgnyZw?view#Workplan-coordination)

## Long-Term Objectives

_We expect these broad objectives to be relatively stable. They represent long-term aspirations that will take some time for us to realize._

- `:scicloj/clj-data-science-grammar`: Use exercises and pedagogical workflow exeriments to define cohesive syntactical grammar/sugar that can bind Clojure libraries together.
- `:scicloj/clj-data-science-environment`: Create a coherent and simple Clojure data science environment in which it is fun and easy to work. This could take the form of a "framework" that leverages standard Clojure data science libraries, or, it could be a looser set of sane defaults for workflows with those libraries.
- `:scicloj/community-development`: Build a good, diverse community, and share that understanding. Build shared connections.

## Near-Term Targets

_We expect these "targets" to change. They represent more short-term or goals or tasks that serve to advance our long-term objectives._

- `:goal-clj-dataset`: Make progress on the question: what is a dataset in Clojure? Is it like a Pandas dataframe (a table)? Is is something with a more nested structure? What project(s) and grammar allow interaction with this dataset?
- `:goal-diverse-community`: Building a diverse and inclusive community.
- `:goal-communicate-values-goals`: Communicate our values and goals to general interested public(s).
- `:goal-simple-first-contribution`: Make it easy to get involved and contribute.
- `:goal-strong-people-bonds`: Build strong bonds between people in the scicloj community.
- `:goal-experimentation`: Experiment with using libraries, workflows, testing datascience grammars, connecting tools, etc.

## Projects

_Projects are concrete efforts that people in this community are working on. They may be short-running or on-going, and one project may serve to advance multiple tasks._
